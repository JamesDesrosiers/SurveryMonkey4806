## Project Description
Users can create surveys with their own questions. Questions may be one of three types:

1. Open-ended (text input)
2. Multiple Choice (radio button)
3. Scale rating (number between _x_ and _y_)

Once their survey is complete, they may publish it.
Once published, anyone with a link may complete the survey and submit it.

The owner of the survey can close it at any time, at which point a report outlining the responses will be generated.
Answers to open-ended questions will be listed.
Pie charts will be generated for multiple-choice questions.
Finally, histograms will be generated for scale rating questions.
